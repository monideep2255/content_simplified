## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access Application**:
   Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
